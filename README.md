This is a project that I have used Python Flask and SQLite technologies in order to create an admin panel that you can add, delete and update restaurants, menus, orders, and users.

With this project, I have my hands on;
  1- Constructing a detailed database with dependencies,
  2- Creating numerous backend routes,
  3- Implementing CRUD operations,
  4- Showing the results with HTML and CSS
